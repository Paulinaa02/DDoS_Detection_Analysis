# DDoS_Detection_Analysis
This project uses machine learning to analyze the effectiveness of algorithms in detecting DDoS attacks on electric vehicle charging systems. Models like Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest are evaluated based on their performance in detecting attack attempts during the EV authentication phase.
